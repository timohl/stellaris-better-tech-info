# stellaris-better-tech-info
This repository contains a script to create two mods for the game Stellaris by Paradox Interactive:
* Better Technology Information
* Tech Tier Events

## Better Technology Information
[Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=924982139)

The "Better Technology Information" mod adds information about technology, which is usually hidden ingame but available for everyone in the gamefiles or on http://www.stellariswiki.com/Technology. 
I wrote this mod, because it was annoying to frequently switch to the browser to look up hidden information.

Ironman compatible: :heavy_check_mark:

## Tech Tier Events
[Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1195902331)

The "Tech Tier Events" mod adds an event chain that counts researched technologies and notifies when a new tier is unlocked.
In the corresponding Situation Log entry, the number of researched technologies per area (phyiscs/society/engineering) and per tier (1/2/3/4) are show.

Ironman compatible: :x:
